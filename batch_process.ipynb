    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will use python to process a large set of data. GIS allows us to visually assess and interact with each step, whilst python allows us to easily scale up to processing large datasets with a single button press, making repeat processing easy. This follows on from the introduction to lidar session and is meant as an introduction to OOSA. We will use lidar data to map biomass along the Spey river valley.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the DTM and DSM provided by the [Scottish government](https://remotesensingdata.gov.scot/data#/list). These were collected as point clouds and then processed to a DTM and DSM in geotiff format. After cloning these will be in the ***data*** directory. The raw data comes in 1 m resolution but the ALS point density was a little too low to support that, so we have coarsened it first to 3 m, taking the mean elevation for the DTM and the maximum elevation for the DSM, and then to 10 m taking the mean for both. Due to disk space limits on noteable, the data has already been coarsened for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 10 m resolution DTM and DSMs are available in the folders below, in geotiff raster format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    data/ALS/DTM\n",
    "    data/ALS/DSM\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on a python cell will be given to show you how that coarsening was done, and a single full-res DSM file has been provided in in case you want to run this process from first principles. Note that you can install Python on your own laptop, or use it on the University's Windows or Linux computers, where you will get access to move more disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download some of these tiles to your computer and view them in QGIS if you would like. Or you can use some of the plotting functions within python to view them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will use the GDAL package to open our data. Below you will see code which uses this module and its functions to open and read GeoTIFF files. Note that *there are many many many Python modules out there, some with overlapping functionality.* Another popular geospatial package is `rasterio`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below provides a function to open a single raster file. This is an example of a **User Defined Function**. After you run the cell, the function can be called just like any of the other functions we use (without needing to import it). See it called toward the bottom of the cell to understand its input ***arguments*** (a filename in this case) and return value list (the data along with the metadata in this case)."
